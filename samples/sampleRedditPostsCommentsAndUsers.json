So I wanted to ask on here so that hopefully someone who used to be in my situation found an answer and can point me in the right direction.\n\nI've been playing video games my entire life, and jrpgs are the only games that have ever really kept my interest till the very end. Games and series like Chrono Trigger (obvs.), Dragon Quest, Crosscode, Final Fantasy, Trails in the sky, and quite honestly every other story rich RPG you can really think of. Growing up with them, I've always felt inspired to create my own one day, but it's always went on the wayside, i took up photography up through high school and then on, working as a freelancer and various other startup companies, I've dabbled in music making and graphic design (which i plan on getting into in the future). After all of that though, I always find myself back to wanting to create my very own game, an RPG with aspects that I like to see in my games all in one package. This is why i'm writing this post, i'm going to try my best to not let this motivation and want to create something, go. i know its possible.\n\nSo that leads me to this, after researching multiple engines, looking at what kinda games have been made on them and how flexible they can be, i've narrowed my possible options down to two different engines,\n\n1. unity\n\nlooking at videos and forums about 2d top down games and the type of games that can come out of an engine like this intrigued me. Even if it may have a learning curve, im used to devoting my time into learning something if the motivation is still there. I also saw that the newly released game \"chained echoes\" was made using the unity engine, which I thought was funny because im currently playing through that right now and I think its brilliant!\n\n2. RPG MAKER MV \n\nI currently own this software, bought it for super cheap years ago and still have never opened the application. I hear a lot of stigma about this engine, that the games that come from it aren't exactly what you call \"quality\", maybe due to its inability to due certain things? but i can also see that as subjective and have seen that games like omori were made on that engine, which is a beautiful game. \n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nI've read that some people start with rpg maker mv to get an understanding on how game development works, but i don't wanna use rpgmaker if one day im gonna scrap my idea and have to relearn everything code wise and try to learn a different engine all together, ya know? \n\nI feel like if i used unity and did my best to learn all the aspects of it and what coding skills need to be required, sometime down the line I'd be able to know enough to start working on my own game and use everything I've already learned into the project tenfold.\n\nwhat do you think?",

This is why i\u0026amp;#39;m writing this post, i\u0026amp;#39;m going to try my best to not let this motivation and want to create something, go. i know its possible.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So that leads me to this, after researching multiple engines, looking at what kinda games have been made on them and how flexible they can be, i\u0026amp;#39;ve narrowed my possible options down to two different engines,\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ol\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;unity\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ol\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;looking at videos and forums about 2d top down games and the type of games that can come out of an engine like this intrigued me. Even if it may have a learning curve, im used to devoting my time into learning something if the motivation is still there. I also saw that the newly released game \u0026amp;quot;chained echoes\u0026amp;quot; was made using the unity engine, which I thought was funny because im currently playing through that right now and I think its brilliant!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ol\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;RPG MAKER MV \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ol\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I currently own this software, bought it for super cheap years ago and still have never opened the application. I hear a lot of stigma about this engine, that the games that come from it aren\u0026amp;#39;t exactly what you call \u0026amp;quot;quality\u0026amp;quot;, maybe due to its inability to due certain things? but i can also see that as subjective and have seen that games like omori were made on that engine, which is a beautiful game. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026amp;#x200B;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I\u0026amp;#39;ve read that some people start with rpg maker mv to get an understanding on how game development works, but i don\u0026amp;#39;t wanna use rpgmaker if one day im gonna scrap my idea and have to relearn everything code wise and try to learn a different engine all together, ya know? \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I feel like if i used unity and did my best to learn all the aspects of it and what coding skills need to be required, sometime down the line I\u0026amp;#39;d be able to know enough to start working on my own game and use everything I\u0026amp;#39;ve already learned into the project tenfold.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;what do you think?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",

You\u0026amp;#39;ll feel right at home with that at least.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Here\u0026amp;#39;s links for you:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.pygame.org/news\"\u0026gt;https://www.pygame.org/news\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.renpy.org/\"\u0026gt;https://www.renpy.org/\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://godotengine.org/\"\u0026gt;https://godotengine.org/\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;",

      "selftext": "My Journey of Creating Hydra Script\n\n[I prefer you watch the YouTube video so more people can find out about my project and follow my journey but if not here's this downloaded video for you to watch.](https://reddit.com/link/11s2g0j/video/y6262b8xpxna1/player)\n\n[https://youtu.be/l-lxS7Q30Vs?list=PLL4Kkq61YncivG\\_CYDvLTREkh1dtnMxul](https://youtu.be/l-lxS7Q30Vs?list=PLL4Kkq61YncivG_CYDvLTREkh1dtnMxul)\n\nHey, I wanted to share with you the story of how I created Hydra Script, a game development engine that allows anyone to create their own games without needing to know how to ~~code~~.\n\nCreating Hydra Script was a challenging but rewarding journey, and it taught me a lot about game development, programming, and debugging strategies.\n\nWhen I first started creating Hydra Script, I didn't have a lot of programming experience. However, I was determined to learn, and I used online resources like Stack Overflow, YouTube tutorials, and forums to teach myself.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges I faced was debugging. As I added more features and functionality to Hydra Script, I encountered a lot of bugs and issues that needed to be resolved. This required me to learn how to debug effectively, which involved a lot of trial and error and experimentation.\n\nOne of the strategies I used for debugging was to break down the problem into smaller parts. I would isolate the section of code that was causing the issue and test it on its own. This allowed me to identify the specific issue and find a solution more quickly.\n\nAnother debugging strategy I used was to step away from the code and come back to it later. Sometimes, when you're working on a problem for a long time, it can be difficult to see the issue clearly. Taking a break and coming back with fresh eyes can often lead to a breakthrough.\n\nThroughout the development process, I faced many technical challenges and setbacks. But each time I encountered an issue, I used it as an opportunity to learn and improve my skills.

However, I was determined to learn, and I used online resources like Stack Overflow, YouTube tutorials, and forums to teach myself.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;One of the biggest challenges I faced was debugging. As I added more features and functionality to Hydra Script, I encountered a lot of bugs and issues that needed to be resolved. This required me to learn how to debug effectively, which involved a lot of trial and error and experimentation.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;One of the strategies I used for debugging was to break down the problem into smaller parts. I would isolate the section of code that was causing the issue and test it on its own. This allowed me to identify the specific issue and find a solution more quickly.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Another debugging strategy I used was to step away from the code and come back to it later. Sometimes, when you\u0026amp;#39;re working on a problem for a long time, it can be difficult to see the issue clearly. Taking a break and coming back with fresh eyes can often lead to a breakthrough.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Throughout the development process, I faced many technical challenges and setbacks. But each time I encountered an issue, I used it as an opportunity to learn and improve my skills. And with each bug I fixed, I gained more confidence in my abilities as a programmer.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;It\u0026amp;#39;s not perfect, and there\u0026amp;#39;s still much work to be done. But I\u0026amp;#39;m proud of what I\u0026amp;#39;ve accomplished so far, and I\u0026amp;#39;m excited to see what the future holds for Hydra Script.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Edit: Realized I forgot to add an image and video and my post got deleted somehow maybe I mis clicked although it didn\u0026amp;#39;t seem like it, it could have happened.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- SC_ON --\u0026gt;",
